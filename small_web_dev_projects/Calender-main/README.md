<p>Welcome to our calendar project, where we bring you an innovative and interactive way to keep track of time. Our unique design features two months displayed side by side, with the option to slide to the next set of months. This makes it easy to plan ahead and stay organized with your schedule.</p>

<p>But that's not all. We understand the importance of cultural celebrations and festivals, which is why we have incorporated a hover feature that displays the name and details of the festival when you hover over the respective date. This feature is designed to help you stay informed about upcoming events and plan your schedule accordingly.</p>

<p>Our calendar project is perfect for individuals who lead busy lives and need a quick and convenient way to keep track of their schedule. With our easy-to-use interface, you can quickly add events, appointments, and reminders to your calendar, making sure that you never miss an important date.</p>

<p>Whether you're a student, professional, or homemaker, our calendar project is the perfect tool to help you stay organized and on top of your schedule. So why wait? Start using our calendar today and make your life easier and more organized than ever before!</p>
