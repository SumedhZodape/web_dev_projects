<p>Welcome to our weather app, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our project is designed to provide you with accurate and up-to-date information about the weather in any city of your choice.<p>

<p>To create this app, we utilized the weather API from https://openweathermap.org/api. By integrating this API into our project, we are able to retrieve real-time weather data and display it in an easy-to-read format.<p>

<p>Using our weather app is simple. All you need to do is enter the name of the city you want to check, and then press the "Enter" button. Our app will then retrieve the latest weather data for that city, including the date, time, and current weather conditions.<p>

<p>Whether you're planning a trip or simply curious about the weather in a particular location, our weather app is the perfect tool for you. With its user-friendly interface and accurate weather data, you can trust our app to provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions.<p>

<p>So why wait? Try our weather app today and experience the convenience and accuracy of real-time weather data at your fingertips.</p>
